### Cifar and Me 
I am working with the CIFAR dataset to explore how to do basic things with Python and Pytorch. I hope to be able to 
save models, continue testing on models, and more to come. 



### Todo list 
- [x] Make basic model
- [x] Set up training on basic model
- [ ] Set up saving weights and parameters of basic model 
- [ ] Set up continue training on basic model 
- [ ] Set up testing on basic model 


### Wish List
- [ ] Set it up with VGGNet
- [ ] Set it up with Resnet
- [ ] Make it work with Object Detection. YOLO? 
- [ ] Look into how to bring in pretrained models
