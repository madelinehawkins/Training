### Pokemon! Gotta detect them all!

This was me playing around with the first generation pokemon and using image classifcation to tell which pokemon is which 
based on an image. 



### Todo: 
- [ ] Create CSV for the Pokemon 
- [ ] Data Preprocesses Pokemon 
- [ ] Create a Basic Model
- [ ] Train Pokemon on basic model and get a good curve
- [ ] Test Pokemon on unseen data

### Wish List: 
- [ ] Deal with Overfitting
- [ ] Data Augmentation? Maybe? 
- [ ] Getting it working well with AlexNet 
- [ ] Look into why Mew and MewTwo are not getting detected at all.
